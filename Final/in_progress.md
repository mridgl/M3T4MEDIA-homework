`*Why did you choose to document your process in this way?*`

I chose to document the image this way in order for the viewer to see how similar the solar panels look to that of normal roof shingles. Instead of words, I wanted to illustrate it as there are little to no solar panels within the city; so I believed having a visual representation of the idea in question would be an appropriate course of action. While it is a sketch -hence the in progress title- it shows what appears to be a normal house with roof shingles when there are actually small solar panels built into each one, providing clean energy for the home.
