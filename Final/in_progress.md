# Solar Phone Case

I chose to document the image this way in order for the viewer to see how the idea of camouflaging solar panels will work with the project in mind. The solar panels will be camouflaged with different designs to appease those who do not want a boring case nor one that looks like someone glued solar panels to the front. They will be designed like normal cases to appease everyone to their own needs.
