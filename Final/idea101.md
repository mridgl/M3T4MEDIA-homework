### IDEA No 101
# **Solar Panels**
In 1839 Alexandre Edmond Becquerel discovered the photovoltaic effect --which in turn explained how electricity can be generated from sunlight. Shining light on electrodes submerged in conductive solution would create electric current, however despite this discovery, it was still deemed as very inefficient. In 1883, an American inventor named Charles Fritz created the first ever selenium solar cell. Unfortunately the power output was no more than 4% which wasn't enough. It took until 1954 for David Chapin, Calvin Fuller, and Gerald of Pearson of Bell labs to create the first photovoltaic cell using silicon. This allowed for sunlight to be converted into electrical power with a much greater output.

During the space age, solar panels were sent into space --the first being the Vanguard I satellite in 1958. This occurred three more times with Vanguard II, Explorer III, and Sputnik-3 in order to power the spaceships.

Over the years, prices of solar panels have risen at first gradually, but then drastically. In the beginning, early solar panels cost $300 per watt. Now in 2019, the average national solar panel cost is $3.05/watt with an average solar panel system size of 6 kilowatts in the US. In total, an average system would cost $12,810 after taxes --which is 2% lower than the previous year.

Fast forward a few years: In 2005, Solar Shingles were created to give solar panels a sleek new look.

Despite being created in 2005, most people are more familiar with Tesla's involvement in the program in 2016. Instead of the normally large and bulky solar panels, the roof would be made out of small solar panels disguised as roof shingles -hence the name. The Tesla Solar Roof is a building-integrated photovoltaic: BIPV for short. These materials are used in order to replace conventional materials such as the roof, skylights, etc. Meaning they can serve as both a normal roof or skylight while continuing to supply energy to the building -saving materials and energy costs in comparison to supplying energy separately.

Currently there are four different designs available for these 'solar shingles'; tuscan glass tile, slate glass tile, textured, and smooth. In order for these to be considered strong enough as roof material, Elon Musk explained in an interview that "It's made of quartz [as it has] a quasi-infinite lifetime" In other words: stating that the roof installations are not only strong enough to hold back the forces of nature along with supply energy, but they have an infinite warranty.

Unfortunately the one downfall of this product is the price. The roof would cost $21.85 per square foot which, for a home needing 2,000 square feet of roofing, would be a little less than $44,000. One customer who had this installation ended up costing $100,000 for the replacement of their 1,000 square foot roof and three Tesla Powerwall 2 batteries. The replacement for the solar roof alone was $70,000 not including the batteries with the system producing 10 kilowatts of power.

Solar panels are still in developmental stages to this day in getting the installation prices lower in order for consumers to actually be able to use the product. Once that happens, people would prefer using cleaner energy as it is both clean and much more convenient to use.
