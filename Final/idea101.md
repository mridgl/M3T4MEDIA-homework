### IDEA No 1
## **Solar Roof**
In a world plagued by smoke, coal, and petrol amongst many other things, the air quality has dropped, global warming has occurred and human health is at risk. To avoid further jeopardizing the Earth and ourselves, steps are needed to be made.

Solar panels are well known as alternatives to power that are 'green'- considered clean and friendly to the environment. However, they are bulky and rather hard to place on a roof and would often have to be set off to the side; thus taking up more space than necessary. That's why, in 2005, Solar Shingles were created.

Despite being created in 2005, most people are more familiar with Tesla's involvement in the program in 2016. Instead of the normally large and bulky solar panels, the roof would be made out of small solar panels disguised as roof shingles -hence the name. The Tesla Solar Roof is a building-integrated photovoltaic: BIPV for short. These materials are used in order to replace conventional materials such as the roof, skylights, etc. Meaning they can serve as both a normal roof or skylight while continuing to supply energy to the building -saving materials and energy costs in comparison to supplying energy separately.

Currently there are four different designs available for these 'solar shingles'; tuscan glass tile, slate glass tile, textured, and smooth. In order for these to be considered strong enough as roof material, Elon Musk explained in an interview that "It's made of quartz [as it has] a quasi-infinite lifetime" In other words: stating that the roof installations are not only strong enough to hold back the forces of nature along with supply energy, but they have an infinite warranty.

Unfortunately the one downfall of this product is the price. The roof would cost $21.85 per square foot which, for a home needing 2,000 square feet of roofing, would be a little less than $44,000. One customer who had this installation ended up costing $100,000 for the replacement of their 1,000 square foot roof and three Tesla Powerwall 2 batteries. The replacement for the solar roof alone was $70,000 not including the batteries with the system producing 10 kilowatts of power.

The Solar Roof is still within developmental stages in determining efficiency and other key factors, but we are closer than ever to clean power sources and, maybe, solving some of the pollution problems we face today.
