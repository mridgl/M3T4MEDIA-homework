### IDEA No 101
# **Solar Phone**
Based off of the solar shingles comes the solar phone. The solar phone, more specifically the case itself, will be fitted with solar panels directly connecting to the phones power source. Not only providing a cleaner use of energy, but making phone usage more practically. No longer will people struggle with finding places to plug in their phones as all they need to do is hold it in direct sunlight whether outside or through a window. The phone will charge within an hour or two depending on the type of case purchased.

There will be two different kinds of phone cases. One with the solar panels being only at the top and bottom of the case. This is more highly sought after in terms of preventing smudges and fingerprints from dirtying the solar panels. However with the panels only being at the top and bottom, the phone will charge slower compared to that of a full sized solar panel case. With the full solar case, the entire phone case will be covered with solar panels with the exception of a small space off to the side where one case easily open and close the case without worrying about dirtying the solar panels. With this case, the phone will be charged much faster, however there is a greater chance of damaging more of the panels.

When purchasing the phone case, it comes with a portable battery for storing extra power for when the sun has set. That way, regardless of what time of the day, your phone batter will have charge one way or another.
