## Week 5 Homework
### *In your own words explain what the Internet is and how it came to be. Give both a technical explanation (that a regular person would understand) as well as historical context.*
`The internet was made not by one person, but by collective things created by separate people and groups before coming together and becoming the Internet everyone is aware of today. In technical terms; the Internet is a global network that connects computers to one another from around the world via networks within one mass network.`

# **Chosen Topic: Solar Panels**

### *-Briefly explain the main idea behind the idea/technology you're researching, what is it exactly? what is it for? How does it work?*
`What I will be focusing on more are the solar panels called Solar Shingles or the Solar Roof. This idea comes from Tesla and the generalized idea is to have solar panels that 1. Blend into ones roof instead of having those large obnoxious looking solar panels. 2. To have solar panels strong enough to act as a source of energy/power but still serve its purpose as a stable rooftop. Energy would be collected during the day, stored, and then made available throughout the nigh, power outages, storms, etc.`


### *-Who are the important people and/or organizations related to this idea/technology? Don't just list names, briefly explain who these are and what their relationship to your research area is.*
`Tesla came up with the idea of having the Solar Roof. As of now, Tesla is the only one related to the project in terms of creation, funding, etc. With the exception of the joint event with SolarCity in Los Angels where the first versions of the product were sold.`


### *-What are the important historical events/milestones in the development of this technology and why do they seem particularly note worthy?*
`Because the product is still new -having been unveiled in October 28, 2016 and only started taking orders May of 2017, there haven't been much historical milestones. However when Tesla began taking orders with a $1000 deposit for the first versions, they quickly sold out in 2018 within the first few weeks from popular demand. Since then, it appears that Tesla has barely shipped any.`


### *-Draw (literally or figuratively) connections between the technology you are researching and other related technology. This could include sub-categories within your research area and/or technological predecessors and/or technology which is otherwise related to your area.*
`Besides the large surface area, this product is basically one large solar panel made out of smaller solar panels. Solar panels are being used more to "stay green" and prevent even more pollution to the planet as well as a convenient way to gain electricity/energy.`
