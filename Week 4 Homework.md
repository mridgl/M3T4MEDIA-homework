## 5 New ideas/projects/technologies Developed in The Past Decade

### 1. *The Self Driving Car*
`The self driving car is, quite frankly, a car that doesn't need a human in order to go from one place to another. It is able to sense the environment around itself, thus allowing it to be able to: Stop at red lights, turn corners, park, and stop before getting to close to another car. While there have been cases of the self driving car having already been created, it wasn't until recently in December of 2018 that the company Waymo -previously known as the Google Self Driving Car project- commercialized the first ever automated taxi service. So far, thirty-three states have authorized the usage of these automatic cars with ten having issued executive orders in relation to them.`

### 2. *Solar Shingles*
`Instead of having large bulky solar panels on top of a roof, Tesla created solar panels that look more like a traditional roof top. The solar panels are made with tempered glass which make it three times as strong as regular housing tiles. Which is probably necessary considering these panels are both your power source and roof -so losing one would mean losing the other.`

### 3. *Bionic Eye*
`The Bionic eye is a very advanced retinal implant that allows visual perception to those who are blind. This is done by sending electrical stimulation to the retina to cause said visuals and is paired with glasses that contains a small video camera in order to capture a scene for it to be viewed. The information is sent to a small computer the patient wears where the scene is processed and transformed into information to the retinal implant. It's more viewing the shapes and colors instead of the exact details.`

### 4. *Google Glasses*
`Although this idea never went into mainstream market, it's concept is still worth mentioning. Similar to a phone, the glasses would allow you to basically carry the internet with you anywhere and everywhere you went. However, instead of typing, the glasses would be equipped with voice commands. It included a touchpad on the side of the glasses allowing users to swipe through interfaces viewed on by the display -sliding backwards or forwards would bring up different things such as weather, phone calls, etc. It never made it to market due to the expenses as no one really wanted to pay $1,500 for a pair of glasses when they could get a phone instead -and for a cheaper price.`

### 5. *Virtual Reality*
`Released in 2016, The PlayStation VR was created by Sony Computer Entertainment. By wearing the visor over the eyes accompanied by the attached headphones, users could physically dive into the game and feel as though they were directly interacting with the digital objects. There are some occasions of nausea associated with the product, but overall VR took the world by storm and drastically affected the video game community in an entirely new way,`
