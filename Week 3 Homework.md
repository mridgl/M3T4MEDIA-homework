### Idea No.19: The Emoticon
*What is a 'flame war' and what does it have to do with emoticons?*

**Answer:** `A flame war is a lengthy exchange of angry/abusive messages between users online in a discussion area. EX: Text messages, emails, etc. It deals with emoticons as people at first did not know how to interpret them correctly and, instead, think of them as offensive.`

*What's the difference between an emoticon and an emoji? Support your answer with references beyond the book.*

**Answer:** `Emoticons [:-P] required the user to "tilt their head" in order to accurately read the face being typed out. They then became images in the mid-90s.`

`Emojis did not involve tilting your head and could be read normally [(^_-)].`



### Idea No.24: The JPEG
*Boulton explains that a JPEG file has 'lossy' compression. Explain what this means. List and explain a few other kinds of image file compression and the image file types associated with them.*

**Answer:** `A lossy compression means that a file size is reduced, in turn, losing data and becoming visibly degraded. Repeated compressions causes a lower quality each time in some cases.
EX: Images, Video, Audio Data.`



### Idea No.45: Metadata
*List and explain a few examples of metadata beyond the examples given in the book.*

**Answer:** `Metadata is data about data. Some examples are:
Tiles and descriptions,
tags and categories,
who created and when -a.k.a dates,
who last modified and when, and
who can access or update.`
